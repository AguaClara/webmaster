          "description": "DOM (dissolved organic matter) is dedicated to improving the removal process of organic matter from water sources. DOM naturally forms as organic materials, such as feces and decaying leaves, break down. When DOM reacts with coagulants, the contaminants aggregate into larger clusters known as flocs, making them easier to separate during the filtration stage. Currently, at the AguaClara Gracias plant, maple leaves break down in water and create issues with taste and visual appeal.",
