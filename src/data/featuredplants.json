    "description": "The Tamara plant began operation in 2008. The Tamara plant has been regularly updated by the Tamara water board to incorporate the latest AguaClara technologies. By providing a highly valued service, the water board is able to charge a higher tariff and use those funds to improve their water infrastructure such as adding a large water storage tank, stacked rapid sand filters, and updated the clarifier to be self-cleaning."
