          "description": "The DOM team is dedicated to improving the removal process of dissolved organic matter from water sources. DOM naturally forms as organic materials, such as decomposed feces and decaying leaves, break down. When DOM reacts with coagulants, the contaminants aggregate into larger clusters known as flocs, which can be readily separated during the filtration stage. At the AguaClara plant in Gracias, Honduras, there is an issue where these flocs aren't sufficiently dense within the sedimentation tank, resulting in their presence in the treated drinking water. To address this challenge, our team is actively exploring methods to increase the density of these particles by adjusting concentrations of clay and activated carbon, making them easier to remove in our AguaClara clarifiers.",

The work of the team includes reviewing previous literature on topics such as turbulent fluid flow, dynamic physics, and ram pump modeling. Additionally, the team designs experiments and fabricates parts in order to test different methods of optimizing the pump. Currently, the work is focused on optmizing the spring configuration used to operate the pump by  applying fluid mechanics to experimental design.",

With the current system, as flocs in the floc filter capture more and more primary particles, they become \"full,\" leaving them unable to capture more particles. As this happens, the removal efficiency of the clarifier decreases. In order to retain the efficiency in the clarifier over time, floc filtration looks to a recycle system that would use shear force to break flocs up enough that they would be able to continue to capture primary particles.",

The team’s goal is to implement a PF200 pilot model in Puerto Rico that is acclimated to its climate. Puerto Rico has frequent storms that lead to highly turbid water. The dose of coagulant, which is a chemical used to aggregate particles for easier filtration, needs to be increased based on these turbidity levels. Often, these rural communities cannot afford to hire a full time operator to monitor the plant’s performance and adjust this coagulant dosing as necessary. PF200’s current goal is to create an automated coagulant dosing model to respond to fluctuating turbidites with minimal interference from an operator. We are studying the amount of coagulant needed per mass of particles present in the influent water and also working on some design changes in the clarifier.",
