DOM naturally forms as organic materials, such as feces and decaying leaves, break down. When DOM reacts with coagulants, the contaminants aggregate into larger clusters known as flocs, making them easier to separate during the filtration stage. Currently, at the AguaClara Gracias plant, maple leaves break down in water and create issues with taste and visual appeal.",

To maintain efficiency, the subteam proposes a recycle system that would use shear force to break up flocs, maximizing their surface area and allowing them to continue capturing primary particles. This system aims to improve the clarifier's efficiency while using a similar coagulant dosage, enhancing its relevance to AguaClara.",
